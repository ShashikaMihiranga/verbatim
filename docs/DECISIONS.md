# Decision log (append only)

## 2026-09-20
- Main goal recorded in `docs/PROJECT_VISION.md`.
- Sign-in page: server rotates between designs A to D per visit, logged for comparison.
- Auth: Clerk custom flow. Database: Railway Postgres. Front end: React plus FastAPI JSON API.
- `app/charts.py` stays as the SVG source at first and is ported to JS only where needed.

## 2026-09-20 (foundation stream)
- `DATABASE_URL` values starting `postgres://` or `postgresql://` are rewritten to `postgresql+psycopg://` (psycopg 3 driver).
- Railway runs `alembic upgrade head` as `preDeployCommand`; `nixpacks.toml` adds Node so one image builds the frontend and serves it.
- Procfile kept as a fallback; `railway.json` also carries the start command.
- Extra tables columns beyond the brief: `datasets.filename/row_count`, `columns.kind/stats`, `themes.answer_refs` (row indexes, for the "link back to real answers" rule).
- No frontend test runner added (skipped to keep the scaffold small).
